## Contributing Guidelines
While Alpha Advanced is an open-source project and is currently accepting contributions, I do not intend for the mod to be a comminuty-led project. As such, there are a few contributing guidelines in place:
1. Try to keep contributions small.
   - This project was never intended to be a community effort.
   - I would like to remain as the primary maintainer, so please leave larger contributions to me.
2. Do not implement denied suggestions
   - Suggestions get denied for a reason. Do not implement them.
3. Refrain from implemented suggestions that have not yet been approved
   - Similar to above. Please do not implement something that I am yet to review.
4. Be respectful.
   - This mod was created to help me relax around my exams.
   - If you do not respect my wishes and follow these guidelines, you will be barred from future contributions.
